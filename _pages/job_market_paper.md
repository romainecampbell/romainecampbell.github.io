I analyze detailed records from the Seattle Police Department and Municipal Court, and national data, to investigate whether police activities can be reduced without increasing serious crime. In response to heightened scrutiny from a federal investigation, officers significantly decreased officer-initiated stops, particularly traffic and suspicious activity stops. I also show that racially diverse communities experienced larger decreases in stops, and stop reductions were more pronounced among junior officers and officers with high arrest propensity in pre-period stops. During the investigation, communities make more 911 calls, possibly to address unmet demand due to officer pullback. Finally, I examine effects on index crime. I find a significant decrease in car thefts in Seattle and can rule out more than a 1 percent increase in other index crimes. Altogether, my findings suggest it is possible to reduce certain police activities without seriously compromising public safety.
