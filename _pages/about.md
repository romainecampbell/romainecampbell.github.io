Beginning July 2026, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/) and the [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. My research focuses on understanding and addressing racial inequality in criminal justice, education, health, and labor market systems.
